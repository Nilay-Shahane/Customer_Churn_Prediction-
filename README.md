##  Model Overview

The model was trained using a telecom customer churn dataset with the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed irrelevant columns (`Surname`, `Gender`, `RowNumber`, `CustomerId`)  
2. **Encoding** – Converted `Geography` column into dummy variables  
3. **Scaling** – Applied `StandardScaler` to numerical features  
4. **Modeling** – Trained using `RandomForestClassifier`  
5. **Evaluation** – Achieved accuracy of **~85–90%**
